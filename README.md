# TextEncryptionDecryptionusingAlternatingStopandGoStreamCipher
Text encryption and decryption using alternating stop and go generator stream cipher in Python
The python script reads a text file 'plaintexttwo.txt' and encrypts the data using key generated by the Alternating Stop and Go stream cipher generator and write the encrypted into a file 'newtexttwo.txt' then decrypts the encrypted data using the same key to get the plaintext back and write it to the file 'newtexttwo.txt'
